# West-Central-Database-Management-Project
## Description & Requirements
Creating a web based database of west central participants with the ability to make any modifications in the database.
## Project Layout, Design, and Developer Documentation
* Project will consist of reactJS as the main framework for the frontend and will be running on a backend server in NodeJS, connecting to a mySQL database.
* After the user logs in, the main page will show the entire database and each row of entries will have buttons on the left on how they can modify that row. The search results would be displayed in a tabular format.
* WebpageDesign.png This shows a design idea of our webpage.
* Use good contrast practice where needed to draw attention to specific parts of the application. Insure the alignment is clean and layout is nice. The design will be simplistic and based on functionality.
* Graphic design principles: https://www.toptal.com/designers/gui/principles-of-design-infographic

## Using the Application 
* This manual is intended to provide instructions for using the West Central Development Project Database application. The application is designed to help users manage their contacts with ease. It allows users to view, add, update, delete and sort contacts from a central location.

* Before accessing the main webpage, you must remember your 6-digit passcode.
Once the application is running and after logging in using the 6-digit passcode, you will be directed to the home page, 
which  displays a table of all the contacts in the database.

using the application.

Notes:
* Sorting by Events Attended will sort the users by # of events attended and in descending order. 
* Sorting all other elements will do so in alphabetical order.

* If you have any problems or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the development team for assistance or further explanations.
